## Equalizing the P with the C
short description: a place to bind all the steps and files necessary for unlocking and tuning the XIAOMI Redmi 13C, regardless of the model, Gale - Gust
### 1. Determining the model in question, Gale or Gust



### 2. Unlocking the Bootloader
### 3. Flashing custom-twrp recovery, depending on the model, in this case combo (Gale - Gust)
a) determining wich miui version you are running

b) selecting the appropriate miui version, making sure it matches your region (Global, EEA, Taiwan) from [ https://mifirm.net/model/gale.ttt ]
> if necessary, as my model came with the miui version I couldn't find, to update to the available versions from the mifirm site (example 14.0.2 to 14.0.16) + sidenote, the unlocked bootloader persists through the update process (at least from my experience)
> > super necessary, in general, for acquiring boot.img and vbmeta.img, which we'll be using to
